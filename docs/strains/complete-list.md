## The Strain List

!!! quote "Our Strains Overview"

    The table above provides a snapshot of the strains we have cultivated to date here at Jaxxels 420 Grow. Each row highlights a different strain, including Mango Haze, Purple Punch, Special Queen #2, and Critical Orange Punch. While the current table primarily lists the strain names, we are continually working to document and update additional details such as Lineage, Sativa/Indica/Hybrid (S/I/H) classification, and predominant Terpenes (Terps).

    These strains have been meticulously chosen and grown based on their potential benefits for medical usage, and we are excited to share our findings and experiences with you. For added context and depth, please refer to the legend/key table below, where you will find comprehensive descriptions and detailed characteristics for each strain.

    Stay tuned as we continue to grow, document, and share more detailed information about each strainâ€™s unique properties and benefits.
